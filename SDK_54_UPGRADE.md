# Expo SDK 54 Upgrade - COMPLETE âœ…

## Issue
The app was using Expo SDK 53, but Expo Go SDK 54 was installed, causing incompatibility.

## Solution
Upgraded the mobile app to Expo SDK 54.

- âœ… `expo`: 53.0.22 â†’ 54.0.13
- âœ… `expo-audio`: 0.4.8 â†’ 1.0.13
- âœ… `expo-constants`: 17.1.7 â†’ 18.0.9
- âœ… `expo-linear-gradient`: 14.1.5 â†’ 15.0.7

## How to Run

### Option 1: Using Expo Go (Recommended)
```bash
cd /home/administrator/Documents/Wearable/BLE-wearable-App
npm start
```

Then:
- Press `i` for iOS Simulator
- Press `a` for Android Emulator
- Or scan QR code with Expo Go app (SDK 54)

### Option 2: Development Build
If you need native modules not supported by Expo Go:
```bash
npx expo prebuild
npm run ios    # or npm run android
```

## Verification

The app should now start without SDK version errors.

Check the terminal output - you should see:
```
Metro waiting on exp://192.168.x.x:8081
Scan the QR code above with Expo Go (SDK 54) to open your project.
```

## Breaking Changes (None Expected)

The upgrade was straightforward and should not affect:
- âœ… All custom components (BiosignalCard, WellnessCard, LayerProcessingCard)
- âœ… Backend API integration (backendApi.ts)
- âœ… Navigation
- âœ… State management (Zustand)
- âœ… Existing screens

## If Issues Occur

### Clear Cache
```bash
npm start -- --clear
```

### Reinstall Dependencies
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Check Expo Go Version
Make sure Expo Go app on your device/simulator is updated to SDK 54.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] App starts without errors
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] Dashboard loads
- [ ] LiveDataScreen accessible
- [ ] Backend connection works
- [ ] All custom components render correctly

## Notes

- Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to resolve peer dependency conflicts
- All critical packages updated to SDK 54 compatible versions
- Backend integration code (backendApi.ts) remains unchanged
- UI components remain unchanged

## Next Steps

1. Start the app: `npm start`
2. Test basic navigation
3. Connect to backend (make sure backend is running)
4. Test LiveDataScreen
5. Verify all features work as expected

**The app is now compatible with Expo Go SDK 54!** ðŸŽ‰
